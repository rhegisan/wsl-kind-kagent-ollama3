# wsl-kind-kagent-ollama3
This repository provides a complete, reproducible setup for running kagent with Ollama in Kubernetes.  It demonstrates how to deploy Ollama inside a cluster, pull free LLaMA models, and configure kagent via Helm to use Ollama as its default LLM provider.  Designed to work reliably on kind + WSL, avoiding host networking issues
